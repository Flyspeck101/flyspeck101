# Hi there. 
## I am Flyspeck101. I am a GitHub user. (Well, duh.) 
I have a bot called Flyspeck102, and you can contact me through it: flyspeck102@gmail.com

I am the owner of [Split Diamond Labs](https://split-diamond-labs.github.io).

You can read more about me at https://flyspeck101.github.io. I'm not going to put it all here because it would make my profile messy. I suffer from ACHOO syndrome, which means I sneeze when I look at bright things.
